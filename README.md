# Summary
The dataset contains information on United State flight delays and flight performance from 2013 until March 2018. 
The project covers four issues:
1. Trend in data and seasonal pattern of domestic flights
2. Distribution of delayed departures depending on the current traffic
3. Open structure of delays
4. Hidden structure of delays, the key role of weather conditions

The first three items can be easily visualized from the downloaded data. The last part required additional data not available for download: two reasons National Aviation System (NAS) delay and late-arriving aircraft are recursive data and require further detailing.
